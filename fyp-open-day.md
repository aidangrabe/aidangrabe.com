Project title: Student Wearable Application  
Supervisor: [Sabin Tabirca](http://www.cs.ucc.ie/~stabirca/)

## Project Objectives
 - Research the underlying Android Wear APIs
 - Create a usable Android Wear application and demonstrate some of it's APIs in action!
 - Create a custom watchface using the official watchface APIs

## Research Project
A simple wear application that demonstrates some of the Android Wear APIs and
shows the raw data acquired from some of the sensors.

## Student Application
An Android Wear and accompanying mobile/tablet application that is aimed at college
students and their day-to-day activities. This involves a to-do list, timetable
and games.

## Custom Watchface
A watchface that displays the user's upcoming calendar events along the circumference
of the watch, allowing the user to know exactly when and where the events occur.

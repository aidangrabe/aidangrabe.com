Calendar Watchface is a custom watchface for Android Wear that displays your
upcoming Google Calendar events along the circumference of the watch.

It displays the events as coloured segments along the outside of the watch
face, which match the colours specified in the phone's calendar. The segments
start at the event's start time, and continue until the end time of that event.

The next event's title is displayed in the center along with it's location.
This is especially useful for students who have lectures in different lecture
rooms.

Student Wear App was created for my final year project in UCC in 2014/2015.
The goal of the project was to explore the newly announced Android Wear operating
system released by Google on March 18 2014.

# Structure
The project was organized into 3 parts:

 1. An experimental application which demonstrated how to do the key things with
    the operating system such as communicating between the handheld and wearable
    devices and accessing sensor data.
 2. A practical wearable/mobile application for students to help them with
    day-to-day activities such as keeping track of their classes and
    assignments. This project was meant to demonstrate a practical usage for
    some of the things shown in the experimental project.
 3. A custom watchface designed to help students keep track of their lectures
    at a quick glance.
